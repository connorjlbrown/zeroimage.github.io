		<p>I made this track in Tidalcycles in about a sitting. I would recommend listening to it with headphones. I definitely want to keep making little one-off tracks like this.</p>

		<p>Made in Ableton live, this one didn't take me a very long time but I was very pleased with the results. I want to continue to take my music in the general direction of placing emphasis on heavy rhythm and bass, and to experiment more with sampling. I was starting to do that in this song, but even now getting samples is a laborious process so I need to streamline that.</p>

		<p>Also made in Ableton live, the Bandcamp version of this is recut from the version I posted on SoundCloud under the name "Catch Hallucinations of 2009 Ringtones". I decided to ditch the egregiously long names since I'm not making midwest emo revival music.</p>

		<p>This was the first Tidalcycles track I have published. I have been messing around with the software for over a year now but I am not where I would like to be with it in terms of spitting out real listenable music at the same scope as Ableton live. I have long since committed to switch to it however as my primary mode of making music, mostly because I don't have access to a computer that can run Ableton these days, and don't have the extra cash to fork over for a Bitwig studio license. I also like working within arbitrary sets of restraints when doing creative work because it forces me to try things I normally wouldn't. Tidalcycles can get super granular when it comes to the ways in which you are able to manipulate samples.</p>

		<p>This was a track I made when I was still learning the very basics of Ableton live. I tried sequencing my own drums for the first time in this track (by hand with a mouse, in the DAW, it's a little rough sounding). There is a melody that can be heard as well which I recorded from my Korg Volca Keys- although I didn't have a USB audio interface at the time, so I hooked the synth up to my guitar amp and recorded that onto the Voice Memo app on my phone. The voice audio is pulled from a video taken on a trip my family took to Hyatt lake when I was in the third grade.</p>

		<p>This was the very first track I ever made, over two years ago now. The voice audio is pulled from Face in the Hall, a song by the Naked Brothers Band. Audio from Pokka Pokka by Fishmans is also used, and played in reverse.</p>
