		<p>While I still don't have a functioning blog, I <em>do</em> know what system I'm going to use now. Recently I repurposed an old laptop I had laying around, and it's now a home server. Right now, I use it as a network drive and a Jellyfin media server but I haven't gotten into the world of Docker containers or any of that stuff quite yet so it's kind of set at those two things for now. </p>
		<p>Also Hashtag cat (my cat) chewed through the cable I had powering the computer, then when I plugged in the spare he chewed through that one as well. Once I have another AC adapter sent to my place from eBay, I can put the thing in a place where he can't reach it, figure out how containerization works and host my webserver on there.</p>
		<p>When that happens, I'll be using <a href="https://writefreely.org/">writefreely</a> as a rolling blog platform. You just deploy this thing on your server and it gives you a rolling page, the link to which doubles as an RSS link. It's got a really clean editor with Markdown built in, which is all I could really ask for. I dunno how long this thing has existed but I'm glad it does now because it's much less cumbersome than lb and ticks all the same boxes for me.</p>
