		<h1 class="flex-header">About me</h1>

		<p>I'm a 23 year old computer science student from the Pacific Northwestern United States. I did musical theatre the whole time I was growing up, and really love performing generally. My interest in technology goes back as far as I can remember. Any electronic device I could get my hands on and mess with, I wanted to. When I was a little older I got into putting custom firmware on my game consoles and mobile devices. I have always really enjoyed changing the appearance of my stuff, and messing around with novel interfaces.</p>
		<p>I went to a small private K12 school until I graduated High School. There were some advantages to growing up with essentially the same small group of people your whole adolesence, but since private schools are subject to basically no regulation in terms of course content. I recall one or two teachers over the years that seemed less than qualified.</p>
		<p>I think my 12 year old self would think the things I'm up to now are pretty cool. My general interests haven't changed a <em>whole</em> lot since I was a kid, I still really like electronic music and computer stuff. I just can do more of the things I wanted to be able to do when I was younger. I used to really want to know how to make music, specfically electronic music, so I figured some stuff out and now I have a pretty decent knowledge base. I can do stuff in a DAW with relative ease, synth terms are familiar to me for the most part, and I don't think my kid self could have imagined live code languages like tidalcycles or strudel existing. I still have a hard time explaining it to people. </p>
